The AI engineer's trajectory initially focused on improving a VPN node testing application. The core challenge then was accurate VPN test results and refining the UI. The user subsequently redirected the task to implement SOCKS5 proxy functionality over PPTP VPN tunnels. The AI engineer made numerous attempts to implement and debug the complex SOCKS5-over-PPTP routing, facing challenges with network configuration (iptables, ip rule, policy routing), Python socket binding (, ), and  hooks (). Multiple errors related to Python syntax,  typo,  not being defined or passed, and  occurred due to manual code patching and version mismatches. The system also suffered from resource issues (, memory limits) and an overzealous monitoring system that reverted node statuses. Despite multiple iterations and external consultation with ChatGPT for architectural recommendations (3proxy, network namespaces), a fully stable and consistently working solution for SOCKS5 over PPTP with correct external IP routing remained elusive, with only partial successes and frequent regressions. The primary blocker shifted from technical implementation of components to their robust, integrated, and reliable orchestration in the given containerized environment. The conversation ended with the user expressing extreme frustration over non-functional solutions and cost.

<product_requirements>
The user required a robust system for testing PPTP VPN node connectivity (, , ) and establishing SOCKS5 proxy connections through these PPTP tunnels. The core problem was inaccurate test results and the inability to establish functional SOCKS5 proxies that correctly routed traffic through the VPN.

Explicit requirements evolved to:
- Implement  to:
    - Verify  or  status.
    - Launch SOCKS5 server with auto-generated unique login/password and a dedicated non-standard port.
    - SOCKS5 must be externally accessible via the server's public IP.
    - Record SOCKS data (IP, port, login, password, PID) in the database.
    - Change node status to .
- Implement  to:
    - Terminate SOCKS5 process by PID.
    - Remove SOCKS data from the database.
    - Revert node to  status.
- Ensure all SOCKS traffic routes through the active PPTP tunnel, displaying the PPTP node's IP, not the server's IP, for external checks.
- UI improvements for  (compact display, dynamic settings, presets) and  (SOCKS button always active).

<pending_tasks>
- Fully stabilize  and  implementation in  to ensure all SOCKS traffic consistently routes through the PPTP tunnel.
- Resolve any remaining Python  or  issues that might arise during patching, ensuring the backend starts reliably.
- Address potential DNS resolution failures when SOCKS traffic is routed through PPTP (e.g., configuring  or explicit DNS routing).
- Refine error handling and logging to pinpoint routing failures more effectively.
- Implement a robust health-check mechanism for SOCKS-over-PPTP tunnels that prevents them from being marked online if traffic isn't flowing correctly.
- Optimize resource usage and stability for running multiple PPTP tunnels concurrently in a low-memory environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to fix the core problem: SOCKS proxies were running, but traffic was not routing through the PPTP tunnels, instead showing the server's IP (167.172.218.138) externally. One proxy had successfully shown a PPTP IP, indicating that the  and policy routing setup could work, but others failed.

The last few interactions highlighted a series of persistent issues:
1.  **Backend crashes**: Repeated  and  in  and  due to complex  or Python scripting for patching.
2.  ** not passed**: The  function in  and  was not correctly receiving or utilizing the  parameter, preventing  from being applied.
3.  ** not active**: Despite attempts to insert  logic, logs showed it wasn't being executed, suggesting the  function in  was being bypassed or the parameters were incorrect.
4.  **Resource constraints**: Occasional  errors indicated the system was running out of memory/process limits.
5.  **Monitoring interference**: The  system was identified as being overly aggressive, prematurely stopping SOCKS services and reverting node statuses. This was repeatedly attempted to be disabled.

The very last exchange involved applying ChatGPT's comprehensive recommendations to solve these problems by:
- Ensuring  is always called for upstream connections.
- Adding  and  with null terminators inside .
- Passing  and  correctly to  instances.
- Ensuring  is called for each SOCKS port.

However, the last commands resulted in  and a backend crash, preventing verification of the fixes. The user expressed extreme frustration and threatened to switch to ChatGPT-5. The system is in a broken state, unable to successfully start the backend due to a syntax error from the latest patch attempt.

<optional_next_step>
Immediately attempt to restore the backend to a working state by reverting the latest problematic changes from  and re-verifying service status.
