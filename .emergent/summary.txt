The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing SOCKS5 proxy functionality over PPTP VPN tunnels. Initial attempts struggled with network configuration (iptables, ip rule, SO_MARK, SO_BINDTODEVICE) and Python code integration. A major turning point was the integration of comprehensive recommendations from ChatGPT-5, which addressed race conditions, resource management (swap), a dedicated watchdog, and robust routing logic via a  script. Key challenges included persistent database inconsistencies (wrong  path), unpopulated SOCKS fields, and an outdated frontend clipboard function. While many systemic issues were resolved, the process highlighted a recurring problem of SOCKS data not being consistently saved and retrieved for all nodes, leading to a state where individual SOCKS proxies could be confirmed working, but the overall system still faced reliability issues in onboarding new nodes or reflecting their status. The work culminated in successfully debugging and verifying a single SOCKS connection, while others remained problematic.

The user required a resilient system to test PPTP VPN node connectivity (, , ) and establish functional SOCKS5 proxy connections routed exclusively through these PPTP tunnels. The central problem was inconsistent and inaccurate test results, coupled with the inability to ensure SOCKS5 traffic correctly used the VPN tunnel's IP address instead of the server's public IP.

Key requirements included:
- ** Functionality**: Verify node status, launch a SOCKS5 server with unique credentials on a non-standard port, ensure external accessibility via the server's public IP (but traffic through VPN), record all SOCKS data (IP, port, login, password, PID) in the database, and update the node status to .
- ** Functionality**: Terminate the SOCKS5 process, clear SOCKS data from the database, and revert the node status to .
- **Traffic Routing Enforcement**: Guarantee all SOCKS traffic exits through the active PPTP tunnel, displaying the PPTP node's IP for external checks.
- **UI Enhancements**: Improve the  for compactness and dynamic settings, and ensure the SOCKS button in  is always active.
- **Watchdog/Self-Healing**: Implement a system that automatically checks SOCKS proxy health, restarts failing ones, marks nodes as  after repeated failures, and manages resource usage (e.g., batch starting SOCKS) for stability on a 1GB RAM server.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue where SOCKS services were launching but their associated data (like , , ) were not being correctly persisted in the database for several nodes. This resulted in the frontend showing an inability to copy SOCKS credentials (due to missing data) and only a subset of launched SOCKS proxies being truly functional.

The investigation revealed that while the  was updated to include a  field in its returned  (fixing a previous  KeyError in ), the  logic was not consistently populating all SOCKS-related fields in the  database model.

A specific test with Node 18 showed that it *did* successfully launch a SOCKS proxy, save its credentials, and correctly route traffic through the PPTP tunnel. This indicated that the underlying routing and SOCKS server logic could work.

However, other nodes (15, 17, 19, 21) failed to get their SOCKS details saved, despite PPTP tunnels appearing to start for them. The AI engineer's last action was to attempt a reset of these problematic nodes by:
1.  Updating their status to  and clearing all SOCKS-related fields in the database.
2.  Killing their associated  processes.
3.  Instructing the user to refresh the admin panel and manually re-launch these specific nodes to see if the issue resolved.

The system is currently in a state where basic SOCKS-over-PPTP functionality is proven for at least one node, but reliable and consistent setup for multiple nodes, especially saving their SOCKS credentials to the database, remains an intermittent problem requiring further investigation.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the re-launched problematic nodes (15, 17, 19, 21) in the admin panel and debug why their SOCKS data isn't consistently saving.
