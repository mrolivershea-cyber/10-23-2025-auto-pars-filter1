The AI engineer primarily focused on stabilizing SOCKS5 proxy functionality over PPTP VPN tunnels. Initial efforts addressed network configuration, Python code integration, and comprehensive recommendations from ChatGPT-5 for robustness. Recurring issues included database inconsistencies (SOCKS data not saving), frontend clipboard functions, and routing problems (). The approach evolved from complex watchdog and retry mechanisms to a simplified light solution where PPTP health dictates SOCKS status. A major turning point was realizing  was called prematurely and  was not running at the correct time or waiting for the PPP interface to be fully up. The latest phase involved creating a universal  script to streamline deployment, which also required fixing Node.js and  version conflicts. The work culminates in preparing a complete installation package for a new server.

The user initially required a resilient system for PPTP VPN node connectivity testing (, , ) and establishing SOCKS5 proxies that exclusively route traffic through these VPNs. Core issues were inconsistent test results, SOCKS traffic not correctly using VPN IPs, and unreliable SOCKS data persistence.

Key features demanded:
-   : Launch/terminate SOCKS5 servers, save/clear credentials, and update node status.
-   **Traffic Routing**: Ensure SOCKS traffic exits via the PPTP tunnel's IP.
-   **Stability/Watchdog**: Implement health checks, auto-restart failing SOCKS, manage resources on a 1GB RAM server.
-   **Simplified Approach**: Later, the user explicitly requested a light solution: if PPTP is online, SOCKS is considered working after a single, quick traffic check. Watchdog should only monitor PPTP health.
-   **Migration**: A critical requirement emerged to create a universal, one-click installation and debugging script for deploying the application on a new Contabo Cloud VPS 30 server.

-   **backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: The main API endpoint for node operations (start/stop SOCKS, status updates).
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include an explicit  after PPTP tunnel creation to wait for PPP interface readiness. The  function was added (with 10s delay, 45s timeout, 1 attempt) and integrated *after* SOCKS data is saved to the database, and  is called explicitly for routing setup.
-   **backend/pptp_tunnel_manager.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Manages PPTP tunnel creation.
    -   **Changes**: Initial attempts to add routing calls here were problematic or superseded. The current state in the trajectory suggests its primary role is to create the tunnel and return interface info.
-   **backend/socks_server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Implements the SOCKS5 proxy server.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use environment variables for , ,  and applied these in , , . Uses  for policy routing.
-   **backend/database.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles database schema and operations for nodes, including SOCKS data.
    -   **Changes**: The schema was previously modified to include . Core operations remain, with modifications in  ensuring SOCKS data is correctly persisted.

-   ** (and )**:
    -   **Importance**: A Python script designed to monitor PPTP tunnel health.
    -   **Changes**: Initially intended for complex SOCKS health checks, it was simplified to primarily monitor if PPTP processes are alive. Its supervisor configuration () was created and adjusted to use the correct Python environment and a 3-minute check interval.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent deployment and functionality issues, specifically:
1.  **Deployment Reliability**: The user expressed frustration that previous fixes and the  script were not reliably translating to a working deployment on a new server, largely due to issues with the  not being committed to GitHub or repository access problems, and environment conflicts (Node.js version, Python  package).
2.  **Core Functionality**: Despite several attempts to fix SOCKS routing and timing, the system was intermittently failing. The AI engineer diagnosed the core routing setup failure () and implemented a fix in  to ensure the PPP interface is fully  before routing rules are applied.
3.  **Universal Installation**: The explicit request was for a single, universal script that handles installation, debugging, and testing automatically on a new server.

The AI engineer's last action was to update  to  (fixing an installation error), create a comprehensive  script (which includes Node.js v18 setup, yarn install v1.22.22
